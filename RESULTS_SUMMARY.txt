                    Predicted Normal    Predicted Attack
Actual Normal           18,734                3,742      (False Positives)
Actual Attack                0                2,514      (True Positives)

TP (True Positives):        2,514  → Correctly detected attacks
FP (False Positives):       3,742  → Normal traffic flagged as attack
FN (False Negatives):           0  → Missed attacks (ZERO!)
TN (True Negatives):       18,734  → Correct normal identification

KEY FINDING: ZERO FALSE NEGATIVES = 0% MISSED ATTACKS
